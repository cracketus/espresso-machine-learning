Hey friend — glad you’re here!

    Add new prompts — in /prompts/general/ or /prompts/domain-specific/

    Share amazing resources — websites, courses, papers → /resources/

    Suggest new sections or features — open an Issue!

    Fix broken links or typos — tiny changes matter too!

    Submit cool ideas — even memes if they're good.

📜 Contribution Guidelines

    Keep things organized — add to the right folder.

    Prefer small, focused PRs over massive ones.

    Use clear commit messages (e.g., fix: correct typo in README).

    Be friendly and respectful — we’re here to build something cool together.

    Don’t spam or self-promote irrelevant stuff (there's a difference between sharing awesome resources and shilling your uncle's NFT project).
